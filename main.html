    <p>Succulents are plants with thick fleshy tissues adapted to water storage. Some succulents store water only in the stem and have no leaves or very small leaves, whereas others store water mainly in the leaves. Their thick leaves still need sufficient water nonetheless. They are an excellent, low maintenance plants for beginners. They thrive outdoors year-round only in warm regions, in other areas they are best as indoor plants.
